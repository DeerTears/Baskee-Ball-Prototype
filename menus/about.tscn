text = "A 3D local multiplayer game about whacking balls at eachother for points, made in Godot.

I started this project on December 1st, and published this prototype on github December 15th. My goal was to take inspiration from this game https://bitzawolf.itch.io/potion-wolf and to create a FPS multiplayer splitscreen game from it. The result was instead a game about whacking balls in first person in an attempt to recreate some of many sports that also feature balls in them. I don't have a precise idea of what the game is going to be about, other than there's probably going to be some golf-with-your-friends stuff going on.

This game is not open-source, it's just source-available.
